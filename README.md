# Toolchain Notes

This repository contains the notes I've taken while diving into the source code of [rolldown](https://github.com/rolldown/rolldown) and [oxc](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc).

An html version can be generated with [`cargo-mdbook`](https://crates.io/crates/mdbook).

[You can read the book directly on github](./src/SUMMARY.md)

# Install

```sh
cargo install mdbook
```

# Generate

```sh
mdbook build .
# generated in ./book
```

# Watch mode

```sh
mdbook watch -o .
```
