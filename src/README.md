# Toolchain Notes

This repository contains the notes I've taken while diving into the source code of [rolldown](https://github.com/rolldown/rolldown) and [oxc](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc).

My goal is to keep track of my findings and understandings. By open-sourcing this, it might help others (those repositories can be hard to dive into).

If you feel like contributing, please do. I try not to link to too specific implementations (which can change over the time).

## Contributing

Click on the link on top right of the book, this will prompt you to fork the project and you will be able to make the modification directly in the github UI.

You can also propose a PR by hand.
