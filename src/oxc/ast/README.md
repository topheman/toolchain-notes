# oxc / oxc_ast

This crate deserves a chapter of itself.

It is split in 3 parts:

1. [The structs that describe each node of the AST](#structs).
2. [A few implementations for those structs](#implementations).
3. [Generated code](#generated-implementations) under [`oxc_ast/src/generated`](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/tree/main/crates/oxc_ast/src/generated) generated by scripts in [`tasks/ast_tools/src`](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/tree/main/tasks/ast_tools/src), based on decorators like `#[ast(...)]`

A few concepts/keywords to be known:

> The Oxc AST differs slightly from the [estree] AST by removing ambiguous nodes and introducing distinct types.
For example, instead of using a generic [estree] `Identifier`,
the Oxc AST provides specific types such as `BindingIdentifier`, `IdentifierReference`, and `IdentifierName`.
This clear distinction greatly enhances the development experience by aligning more closely with the ECMAScript specification.

- [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree): Abstract Syntax Tree
- [estree]: one of the standard for representing an AST for JavaScript programs
  - There are other kinds of ASTs
