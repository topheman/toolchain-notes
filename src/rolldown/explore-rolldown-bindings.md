# rolldown / Bindings (rust/js)

Before reading this chapter, take a look at:

- [`rolldown_binding` crate](./explore-shared.md#rolldown_binding)
- [rolldown / rolldown (js) - bundling](./explore-rolldown-js-bundling.md)

The topic of this chapter is how does the `napi` bindings declared in the [`rolldown_binding`](https://github.com/rolldown/rolldown/tree/main/crates/rolldown_binding) crate (and the [code generated from it](./explore-rolldown-js-bundling.md)) are finally consumed.
